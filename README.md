# Data analysis with Python 2020
The MOOC covers Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and SciPy. These are used for data cleaning, grouping, creation of summary statistics, and for machine learning tasks such as linear regression, Naive Bayes, PCA, and clustering. 

Each folder contains the exercise solutions and their required input files.
